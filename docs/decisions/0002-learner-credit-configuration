2. Learner Credit Configuration: Provisioning
--------------------------------

Status
------

Accepted

Context
-------

We would like to be able to configure enterprise customer's settings outside of the Django application. 
Initial creation learner credit configuration called 'Provisioning' will be used to create, edit, and delete policies.
Policies are a new system for allocation of funds for an enterprise customer's subsidy. 

A single subsidy can contain multiple policies, where the learner credit funds can be divided amongst policies. A single policy 
will contain the total amount allocated by the learner credit subsidy. 

Decision
--------

* 'Configuration' dropdown in the navigation bar with the following options
    * Provisioning
* 'Dashboard' style page to contain list of customers that can be selected for editing and deleting policies
* 'Provisioning' style page to contain a form with the following fields to create a new policy and new subsidy
    * Enterprise Customer UUID
    * Financial Linkage Identifier
    * Start Date
        * Date from selectable calendar
    * End Date
        * Date from selectable calendar
    * Number of Policies
        * Defined as one policy or 2 policies
* When creating a new policy the following fields will be displayed for a **single policy**
    * Display name
    * Catalog Type
        * OC + Exec Ed
        * OC Only
        * Exec Ed Only
        * Custom
            * For the custom query case, this involves writing a content_filter json blob directly on an EnterpriseCustomerCatalog record
                * To do so, the user would then have to redirect to the LMS Django screen to modify an existing EnterpriseCustomerCatalog and either:
                    * Bring in the UUID for the EnterpriseCustomerCatalog representing their custom catalog
                    * Select from a dropdown to select the existing customer catalog as their custom catalog 
                * The enterpriseCustomerCatalog will represent the custom catalog selection for the single policy created
            * If the user chooses not to select the existing customer catalog, they will select from a dropdown to select an existing enterpriseCustomerQuery
                * They will also have the option redirect to the LMS Django screen to create a new catalog query and select it from the support tools
                    *  The support tools will also create a new catalog from the catalog query and assign the newly created catalog to the single policy created
    * Total Funds **(per policy spend cap)**
        * For a single policy, represents the total amount for the learner credit subsidy 
    * Learner Restrictions **(per learner spend cap)**
* When creating a new set of policies, the following fields will be displayed for **each policy**
    * Display name
    * Catalog
        * Will be displayed as auto selected with no additional options
        * Will be either OC only or Exec Ed only
    * Total Funds **(per policy spend cap)**
        * The total funds represent the funding for the specific policy being created
        * Total fund for the learner credit subsidy will be a summation of each created policy
            * LC Subsidy Funding = Funding from Policy X + Funding from Policy Y
    * Learner Restrictions **(per learner spend cap)**
        

Consequences
------------

* Allows ECS to quickly create a new set of policies for a specific enterprise customer in a single navigatable tool
* Reduces context switching between pages
* Imports relevent information for the customer for creating, editing and deleting policies
* Restricts customization of catalogs to specific catalog queries for multiple policies
* Reduce risk of errors from creating a custom catalog for a single policy
* Standardize creation of subsidies and policies for learner credit
